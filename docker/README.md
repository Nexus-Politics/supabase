# Supabase Docker

This is a minimal Docker Compose setup for self-hosting Supabase. Follow the steps [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/docker) to get started.

## Ports

Beware of the ports that docker automatically might expose, check the `./docker-compose.yml` file. 
Already changed the config so that only the port for kong gets exposed.
